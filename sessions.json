Providing your content as a podcast enhances your reach as the podcast can then be made available through all major podcasting platforms (Apple, Google, Spotify, Pocket Casts, iHeart, ...). Creating and maintaining a podcast is also much easier than a video blog for instance. With proper Structured Data automatically generated, this can also increase your content visibility in Google.

Security – HTTPs as the norm, every important/growing website on its own server)   3.
